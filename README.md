# Stat-479---Consumer-spending

We compare deep learning and machine learning learning methods for a classification problem on a large tabular dataset looking to predict what spending category a consumer
will be in based on various consumer attributes, including age group, gender, occupation group, and more. It was found that a basic Softmax Regression architecture as well as the Multilayer Perception (both using Cross Entropy loss functions) could not outperform a random forest classifier, largely due to our underlying datasetâ€™s explanatory variables not having much variation.
